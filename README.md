## About

This project is an advanced Android application that integrates real-time location tracking using multiple beacons and a deep learning-based model. The app is designed to provide precise location coordinates in real-time, making it suitable for various location-based services.

# Key Features:

- Multi-Beacon Support: The app can utilize up to 4 beacons simultaneously, allowing for accurate triangulation and location determination.
- Deep Learning Integration: A sophisticated deep learning model is embedded within the app, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the location services.
- Real-Time Display: Users can view real-time location coordinates directly within the app interface, ensuring they have up-to-date information at all times.
This project is ideal for developers and organizations looking to implement cutting-edge location tracking technology in their Android applications.
